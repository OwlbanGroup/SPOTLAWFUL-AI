# Network Configuration Instructions for SPOTLAWFUL AI LAN Deployment

## 1. Server Network Setup

- Assign a static IP address to the server machine or configure a DHCP reservation in your router to ensure the server IP does not change.
- Verify the server is connected to the LAN and can be pinged from client devices.

## 2. Firewall Configuration

- Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.
- Create a new inbound rule:
  - Rule Type: Port
  - Protocol: TCP
  - Port Number: 5000
  - Action: Allow the connection
  - Profile: Private (and Public if needed)
  - Name: Allow SPOTLAWFUL AI API Server Port 5000
- Ensure no other security software blocks inbound connections on port 5000.

## 3. API Server Configuration

- The API server is configured to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 5000 using the Waitress server.
- Confirm the server is running and listening on the correct port.

## 4. Router and Network Policies

- Verify LAN routing allows traffic between client devices and the server.
- If VLANs or subnet segmentation are used, ensure routing and firewall rules permit access.

## 5. Client Access

- Clients should access the API using the serverâ€™s LAN IP and port 5000.
- Test connectivity using curl, Postman, or a browser.

## 6. Monitoring and Maintenance

- Monitor server uptime and network performance.
- Regularly review firewall and network policies.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Use `ping <server_ip>` to check basic connectivity.
- Use `telnet <server_ip> 5000` or `Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <server_ip> -Port 5000` in PowerShell to test port accessibility.
- Check Windows Event Logs for firewall or network errors.
